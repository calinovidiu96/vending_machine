## Vending Machine
This backend APP is a simple platform powered by Node.js and Express, offering a straightforward experience for buyers and sellers. With practical API endpoints, it manages user authentication, product actions, and transactions. Utilizing MongoDB for data storage and JWT tokens for security, it's as straightforward as operating a vending machine.

## Key Features:
 - User Management: Create accounts, log in securely, and manage deposits.
 - Product Operations: Add, update, and delete products with role-based access control.
 - Transaction Processing: Buy products, ensuring stock availability and managing user credits.
 - Flexible and Secure: JWT-based authentication, and error handling for a reliable experience.

Make sure you have the following installed before running the app:
